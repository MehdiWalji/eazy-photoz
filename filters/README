This directory contains FILTER.RES files suitable for use with EAZY, FAST,
InterRest, HyperZ, etc. Each filter response has been interpolated (conserving
"flux" as in EAZY, FAST, InterRest) to R=300. I have verified that you get
nearly identical results with EAZY when you use the full or R=300 interpolated
response files.

The FILTER.RES.latest.info file is not required by EAZY, but it is helpful to
show you what filter number (first column), which you do need for EAZY,
corresponds to the filter you're interested in.
